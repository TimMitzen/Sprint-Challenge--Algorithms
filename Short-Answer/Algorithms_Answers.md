#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)linear, because of n that determines the times the loop runs


b)quadratic time cause it has a nested loop


c)linear, cause its reclusive

## Exercise II
Binary search
 
The way to determine f is by dropping the egg from halfway up the building.  
If egg breaks:
the floor is either correct or too high-
halfway between all the lower floors  
If the egg !break: 
then f is higher than the floor chosen- 
next floor that should be picked is halfway between the top
else: 
continue to drop eggs at the halfway 
mark of the untested area until you get a broken egg at a floor 
directly above a floor where the egg does not break
logarithmic
